# BG3-modfile-generator

This is a python script to automatically generate the `modsettings.lsx` file based on the installed `.pak` files in the mod directory.

***AS OF WRITING THIS, IT DOES NOT WORK YET***

## Disclaimer

I have made this script because I got annoyed at how all of the mod tool do not have a Linux version. That means it is **untested** for Windows.

## Other

The initial implementation came from [LSLib](https://github.com/Norbyte/lslib). As it was in C# I had no use for it, so I transpiled the uncompressor myself into Python. The LSLib project has no association with this one.

(I don't know if I need to add LSLib into a file or something, as I don't use their code directly. If what I'm doing is wrong let me know immediately.)
